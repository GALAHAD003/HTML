    </font>
    <font color="black" size="4">RRR[a] is a 2022 Indian Telugu-language epic period action drama film directed by S. S.
        Rajamouli who wrote the film with K. V. Vijayendra Prasad. It is produced by D. V. V. Danayya of DVV
        Entertainment. The film stars N. T. Rama Rao Jr., Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Shriya Saran,
        Samuthirakani, Ray Stevenson, Alison Doody, and Olivia Morris. It is a fictional story about two Indian
        revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Rama Rao), and their fight against the British
        Raj.

        Rajamouli came across stories about the lives of Rama Raju and Bheem and connected the coincidences between
        them, imagining what would have happened had they met, and been friends. Set in 1920, the plot explores the
        undocumented period in their lives when both the revolutionaries choose to go into oblivion before they began
        the fight for their country.

        The film was formally announced in March 2018. Principal photography of the film began in November 2018 in
        Hyderabad which went on until August 2021, owing to the delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was
        shot extensively across India, with a few sequences in Ukraine and Bulgaria. The film's soundtrack and
        background score is composed by M. M. Keeravani with cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar and editing by A.
        Sreekar Prasad. Sabu Cyril is the film's production designer whilst V. Srinivas Mohan supervised the visual
        effects.

        Made on a budget of ₹550 crore (US$72 million), RRR was initially scheduled for theatrical release on 30 July
        2020, which has been deferred multiple times due to production delays and followed by the pandemic. The film was
        released theatrically on 25 March 2022, and opened to positive reviews from the critics with praise for the
        performances and screenplay. With ₹240 crore (US$31 million) worldwide on its first day, RRR broke the record
        for the highest opening-day collection earned by an Indian film. As of 1 April 2021, the film grossed over ₹700
        crore (US$92 million) worldwide, making it the ninth highest-grossing film of 2022, and set several other box
        office records for an Indian film.</font>
